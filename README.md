### Description
A small directory information tool

### Information
More Python practice. This is sort of a folder size / folder info tool. I do a lot in Powershell, but to learn Python I am "converting" some of my Powershell scripts into Python programs.

This tools has taught me a few things about the os module, getting information from a directory, and looping through some information to spit out results.

Any suggestions on my first project, just let me know. I would appreciate the feedback. Again, I am a beginner.
